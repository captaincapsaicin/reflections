When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you're collaborating with many people who all need access remotely

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Changes in the remote repository might break what you're working on, you might need to resolve conflicts at a later time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks - for copying a project completely and using it as a base for a new (unlinked) project
Clone - for copying (syncing) a project locally for development
Branch - for trying out a new line of development on an existing project (new feature, core rewrite, different user attempts at the same thing), to be discarded or eventually
merged back

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows you to see what is available online for others, and also allows you to pre-emptively fix conflicts
