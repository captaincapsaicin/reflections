What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, git initializes an empty repo that is ready for commits
Then you can track which files are being tracked... I suppose

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's an intermediate stage, where you can add files once you're done modifying them, but not done with the overall change
you want to commit. It let's you edit a commit beforehand with mult. files.
