Reflection 1:

using diff made it easy to see what changes were made to a file and quickly spot errors

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can work quickly, and if you make mistakes, can look back to old versions that are working without being afraid of breaking everything

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros: can make logical commits + comments
Cons: may not have enough commits

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

In coding, multiple files are often interconnected. In word processing, this is often not the case

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log gives you a log of each commit with a smal message about it. diff allows you to compare the prvious state to the next state.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can always go back!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Developing large projects and working with teams
